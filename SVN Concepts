What is SVN (Subversion)?
SVN stands for Subversion. It is called as SVN because of its commands (its command name svn). 
It is a centralized version control system. It is an open-source tool for version control.

Components of SVN
There are two core components of SVN; they are as follows:

SVN server
SVN client

Repository: A repository is the heart of any version control system. 
It is the central place where developers store all their work. Repository not only stores files but also the history. 
Repository is accessed over a network, acting as a server and version control tool acting as a client. 
Clients can connect to the repository, and then they can store/retrieve their changes to/from repository. 
By storing changes, a client makes these changes available to other people and by retrieving changes, a client takes other people's changes as a working copy.

Trunk: The trunk is a directory where all the main development happens and is usually checked out by developers to work on the project.

Tags : The tags directory is used to store named snapshots of the project. 
Tag operation allows to give descriptive and memorable names to specific version in the repository.

For example, LAST_STABLE_CODE_BEFORE_EMAIL_SUPPORT is more memorable than

Repository UUID: 7ceef8cb-3799-40dd-a067-c216ec2e5247 and

Revision: 13

Branches: Branch operation is used to create another line of development. 
It is useful when you want your development process to fork off into two different directions. 
For example, when you release version 5.0, you might want to create a branch so that development of 6.0 features can be kept separate from 5.0 bug-fixes.

Working copy: 
Working copy is a snapshot of the repository. 
The repository is shared by all the teams, but people do not modify it directly. 
Instead each developer checks out the working copy. 
The working copy is a private workplace where developers can do their work remaining isolated from the rest of the team.

Commit changes: 
Commit is a process of storing changes from private workplace to central server. 
After commit, changes are made available to all the team. 
Other developers can retrieve these changes by updating their working copy. 
Commit is an atomic operation. 
Either the whole commit succeeds or is rolled back. 
Users never see half finished commit.

✅ In short: Use svn checkout to get files, svn add and svn commit to save changes, svn update to stay in sync, and svn log to track history.


Command			| Purpose										| 	Example Usage
svn checkout	| Get a working copy from repository			| 	svn checkout https://example.com/svn/repo
svn add			| Add new files/directories to version control	| 	svn add newfile.txt
svn commit		| Save changes to repository					| 	svn commit -m "Added new feature"
svn update		| Sync working copy with repository				| 	svn update
svn status		| Show status of files							| 	svn status
svn diff		| Show differences between local and repo		| 	svn diff file.txt
svn log			| View commit history							| 	svn log
svn revert		| Undo local changes							| 	svn revert file.txt
svn delete		| Remove files/directories from repo			| 	svn delete oldfile.txt
svn list		| List files in repository						| 	svn list https://example.com/svn/repo



📝 Notes
Always use clear commit messages (-m "message") for tracking changes.

Run svn update frequently to avoid conflicts.

Use svn revert before committing if you want to discard local changes.
